    "I have made decent progress on my project as of this point, I have written out a decent python helper module very similarly to the code we are writing in class to interact with the Steam API. I can gather general information about individual games as well as information pertaining to individual players and the games they own/play. I have written a few functions to scrape web endpoints including a very cool one that effectively allows me to search for steam users using their search function which is not an offered API. This required use of selenium to simulate a browser environment with running javascript. I have also designed a database schema and will be using MySQL as my database of choice for this project. My next step will be to populate this database with all games, their achievements, and current player counts. The user specific data will be input on an ad-hoc pace as I hope to include functionality for a simple search system to search for users and view their game data. I hope for the final product to be a simple search scenario where you can search for a user and find information about what games they own and look at their stats for those games."

    "Though much of the data is available through Steam's public API (provided you have an API key) I still had to employ some small workarounds for specific endpoints. The search endpoint for example uses javascript to populate the search results which will not be present in a standard HTTP response. This required use of the Selenium python module which actually executes a browser that performs the request and if you wait long enough executes the javascript. This allowed me to essentially wrap Steam's user search endpoints so my app can include user searching. Otherwise most data was available through the API or through some relatively simple scraping using BeautifulSoup just like in class. "
